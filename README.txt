# bad_adventure_game
This is a shitty game I made to practice OOP in Python. Play at your own risk.

-Gameplay sucks
-Graphics suck
-Combat system sucks
-It is unbalanced
-It isn't fun
-It ins't entertaining
-and probably buggy as hell

if you still wanna play run "game.py" with Python 3.10

Oh and also I have not implemented death, so at least you can't die I guess.
